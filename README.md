## Online Shopping Website

This website is powered by Vite + React and explores the core functions needed to build an E-commerce site purely on the frontend.

## User Guide

This site serves as a mock-up for a typical e-commerce website with simple features such as:

- Randomly generated item list to select your desired purchase from
- Filtering items on the clothing page by price or rating
- Adding/Removing items from your shopping cart
- Adding items from the clothing page to favorites page

There is **no** backend for this site so certain buttons do not have functionality as it is outside of the scope of the intent for this website.

## Known Issues/Contributions

No known major issues that aren't responsive related. Any help is cleaning up the CSS is appreciated!

## Major Takeaways

Since this quick project served as my first introduction into using Vite one major takeaway it the sheer speed Vite and flexibility provides over CRA without too much new knowledge to obtain. Because of this Vite definitely takes precident for my projects moving forward.

## Final Notes

This is my very first project in Vite/React so any feedback is greatly appreciated. I am always looking for opportunies and collaborations with other developers or artist at any level so please reach out and [lets work](mailto:ocean.wrng@gmail.com) on some stuff!
